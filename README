 Introduction
 ============

 HTCflasher is a free (GPL'd) tool to work with HTC based bootloaders (SPLs).

 Currently most new HTC devices are supported, and the basic set of functions
 to work with every HTC bootloader has been implemented, so adding support
 for new bootloader versions or new devices should be quite easy to do, if
 not working out of the box.

 Use it with CARE. If you don't know what you're doing you can brick your
 device. Keep in mind that future / untested bootloaders can break backward
 compatibility. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.


 Supported devices
 =================

 HTCflasher has been tested on the following devices:

 * HTC Hermes: works on SPL versions >= 2.x
 * HTC Trinity: works on all SPL versions
 * HTC Kaiser: works on all SPL versions
 * HTC Shangrila (Shift): works on all SPL versions
 * HTC Polaris: works on all SPL versions
 * HTC Elf: works on all SPL versions

 * HTC Diamond
 * HTC Titan
 * HTC Gene
 * HTC Pharaos
 * HTC Juno
 * HTC Sedna

 Also should work on Smartphone platform:

 * Excalibur, Monet, Oxygen, Vox, Wings, Cavalier, etc...

 Can it be used in other new devices?

 Probably yes, all new devices using NBH format for rom upgrades should be
 supported out of the box, at least until HTC changes the SPL commands :)

 Can it be used in other old devices?

 Probably not, HTC Flasher v3 only supports devices using NBH ROM format,
 if your device uses older NBF files it is currently not supported.

 Your feedback/patches are more than welcome :)
